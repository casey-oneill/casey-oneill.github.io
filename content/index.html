        <p>I'm a second-year master's student in Human-Computer Interaction at the University of Waterloo, supervised by <a href="https://edithlaw.ca/bio.html">Dr. Edith Law</a> in the <a href="https://edithlaw.ca/index.html">Augmented Intelligence Lab</a>.</p>
        <p>My recent work focuses on the personification of conversational agents, such as voice assistants and robots. See my <a href="/research/">research page</a> for more details.</p>
        <p>I previously completed my undergraduate studies at the University of New Brunswick, where I <a href="https://www.unb.ca/academics/calendar/undergraduate/current/frederictonprograms/bachelorofarts/concurrentdegrees/concurrentdegreeinartsandcomputerscience.html">concurrently</a> earned a Bachelor of Computer Science with thesis-based Honours, supervised by <a href="https://hci.cs.umanitoba.ca/people/bio/daniel-rea">Dr. Daniel Rea</a>, and a Bachelor of Arts with a major in Philosophy.
