<h2>Hi, I'm Casey!</h2>
<p>I'm a second-year master's student in Human-Computer Interaction at the University of Waterloo, supervised by <a href="https://edithlaw.ca/index.html">Edith Law.</a></p>
<p>I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of New Brunswick, where I earned a Bachelor of Computer Science with Honours, supervised by <a href="https://hci.cs.umanitoba.ca/people/bio/daniel-rea">Daniel Rea</a>, and a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy.</p>
<p>My recent work focuses on social robotics and the personification of conversational agents, such as voice assistants and chatbots. See my research page for more.</p>
