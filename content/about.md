I'm a M.Math graduate student studying Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca), Ontario, Canada. I'm supervised by [Dr. Edith Law](https://edithlaw.ca). I've also worked with [Dr. Daniel Rea](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/daniel-rea-94279a47) during my undergraduate studies at UNB. My thesis explores how we interact with artifical agents such as robots and chatbots.

I grew up on a dairy farm in rural New Brunswick. In 2023, I graduated from the [University of New Brunswick](https://www.unb.ca) with a Bachelor of Computer Science and a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy. My love of learning and interest in UI/UX development and video games led me to pursue a master's in HCI.

I'm a coding enthusiast, and I work on projects like video games and websites in my spare time. When I'm not coding, you can find me playing video games or taking long walks. I'm also a music enthusiast! I made this playlist to share my favourite songs with you.
