## Check back in later!

I have been added as a co-author to two separate in-progress projects. The papers will be submitted to the [CHI 2025](https://archive.sigchi.org/conferences/upcoming-conferences/) and [ICSR 2024](https://icsr2024.dk) conferences. These projects are supervised by [Dr. Edith Law](https://edithlaw.ca) of the University of Waterloo and [Dr. Daniel Rea](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/daniel-rea-94279a47) of the University of New Brunswick, respectively.
