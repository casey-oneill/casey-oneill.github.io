# Personal Website

This is my personal website. It uses [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) with the following technologies:

- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) static site generator
- [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com) themes for [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) and [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com)

## Develop

Make sure [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is installed before running locally. Use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) to manage dependencies. To run, use the command: `npm start`.

## Deploy

This project is configured for automatic deployments from the `master` branch using GitHub Actions.
